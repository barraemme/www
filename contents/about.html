<h1>About <strong><a href="./">Snowshoe</a></strong></h1>

<p>Snowshoe is an open source project to build a cross platform browser application with multiple user interfaces while sharing the same core engine, based on <a href="http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt_5.0">Qt5</a> and <a href="http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebKit2">WebKit2</a> technologies.</p>

<p>The user interfaces are implemented in <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/qt5-snapshot/qtquick2-qtquick-reference.html">QML</a> and have a strong focus on both the usability and the user experience on different platforms - desktops, mobile phones, tablets, etc. Special attention is given to the requirements and restrictions of each platform, like screen size, input methods, memory and processing power.</p>

<p>The Snowshoe community is formed by developers, interaction and graphical designers from many places around the world and all the development is supported by Nokia Institute of Technology (<a href="http://www.indt.org">INdT</a>) , a non-profit organization in Brazil.</p>
